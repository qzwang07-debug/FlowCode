// Scenario model for the **builder** evals.
//
// Unlike the describer evals (which score how a recording is reconstructed), these
// score the *final stage*: how the builder GENERALIZES an approved analysis into a
// runnable artifact. The variance we care about here is native-tool choice — e.g.
// mapping GitHub work to the `gh` CLI instead of replaying github.com through the
// browser. To isolate the builder from describer variance, each scenario ships a
// FIXED analysis (as if the describer had produced it); the harness seeds it to
// disk and runs the real builder against it.
