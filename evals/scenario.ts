// Scenario model + authoring helpers for the describer evals.

// A scenario is a fixed, synthetic recording (a list of captured OS events) plus
// a rubric describing what a good analysis of it looks like. Fixtures are
// deterministic and video-less on purpose: they isolate the part of the system
// with real variance — the multi-turn Copilot describer — from flaky live
// capture, so the eval is repeatable. The events are authored to mirror what the
// real collectors would emit for the same task (see evals/mocks/*.html for the
// pages these flows reference).
